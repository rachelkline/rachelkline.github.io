Personal Portfolio

In this assignment, we were tasked with updating our functional, deployed website and updating our portfolio to include our recent group project and two homework assignments. We also had to update our contact informtion to include our phone number a&nd email, add links to our linkedIn & gitHub, and add our resume. For each portfolio item, we had to include a link to the deployed, a link to the repository, and give a short description of the project.

We also were tasked with pinning some of our repositories on gitHub and updating our linkedIn profiles to include this course in our education.
