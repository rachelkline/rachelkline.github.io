Personal Portfolio

In this homework assignment, we were tasked with creating a functional, deployed website that will become our portfolio. We were given examples as to how the style/layout could resemble, however we did not have to follow the guide exactly as we were given some creative freedom.
We had to create a an About Me page with a picture and description detailing ourselves; we had to create a porfolio page with five responsive images/cards; and we had to create a Contact page with an email input and a message bar. We were not tasked with actually making the email/message blocks actually work.

We also had to create a Navbar at the top of every page that contained links to our Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages. The navbar had to be consistent on each page. All of our links need to work. We were also tasked with using semantic HTML, as well as valid and correct HTML. Lastly, we had to properly utilize Bootstrap components and the grid system. This meant that our webpage had to work on all types of devices, not just computer screens.
