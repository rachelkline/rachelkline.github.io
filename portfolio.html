            <h3 class="card-title" id="StockBody">The StockFinder website, which we called "What the Stock", was our first collaborative coding project.  We had a list of criteria given to us which we followed. It included the use of at leat two API's, one of which had to be something other than what we used in class.  We used four API's, none of which were ones we used in class. Our criteria also included the use of a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.  We used a framework called "Bulma", which was fairly intuitive and we easily adapted to it.
              <br>
              <br>
            Originally we met and brainstormed various ideas, weighing the pro's and con's of each, and then took a vote by ranking the choices of subjects for our site.  The stock market idea won slightly over a site about dogs.  We then sketched out a wireframe. From here, we set up a Kanban project area on gitHub to manage our work and brainstormed a list of tasks.  While we mostly kept to that project manager framework, we eventually ignored it and just worked on our pieces to get the job done, helping each other when we could.
              <br>
              <br>
            We met in our Zoom classroom breakout rooms during class and office hours, then on Google Meet for the remainder of the time so that we could easily collaborate. Our biggest takeawys were:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>-Learning how to work with API's and manipulate them by stacking</li>
              <li>-Learning to work in a team</li>
              <li>-Learning how to create links from APIs that direct the user to another website.</li>
              <li>-Learning how to use gitHub for collaboration</li>

            <h3 class="card-title" id="StockBody">'Simple Resume' is our second collaborative coding project.  The criteria we were tasked to meet in this assignment was to create a functional application (utulizing one new technology that we haven't discussed in class yet) and utilize MySQL database in some way. We were also required to deploy our application to Heroku.
              <br>
              <br>
            Our group decided to create an application that would generate a simple, clean resume. We wanted it to be user-friendly, so that someone could easily enter in their information(such as job history, relevant skills, education, and professional summary) and be returned a sleek resume that is able to be downloaded as a PDF file. We accomplished this by associating the unique user ID to two different tables. Once the user is 'logged in', only their unique ID is able to be used to access information in the database.
            <br>
            <br>
            The technologies we used to create this app are:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>-Handlebars (to create the HTML structure and resume template</li>
              <li>-Passport and Bcrypt for password authentication</li>
              <li>-MySQL Database to store user information in 3 different tables</li>
              <li>-Sequelize ORM</li>

This application lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. When the user submits a burger's name, the burger is displayed on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured.
              <br>
              <br>
            The application was created using Handlebars partials. This was my first time using Handlebars and I really gained a liking for it! Each burger has a Devour button that when clicked, will move the burger to the right side of the page. Every burger is stored in a database, whether devoured or not. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We were also challenged to add a DELETE button and make it functional (able to be deleted from the database) as a bonus.</h3>

The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. The assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will then create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the user-provided information.

            The employees are generated using a standard "Employee" class, then based on the user-input, they are then classified as either a Manager, Engineer, or Intern. Depending on the job title chosen, different questions will be prompted and appended to the HTML file.
              
            We were given free-reign for styling. In my example, I used my favorite video game characters (from the Legend of Zelda) and decided to build my color-schemes and fonts around that game!</h3>
